    st.markdown("""
    This application leverages advanced artificial intelligence techniques to analyze images of tomato leaves. Here's a simplified breakdown:

    1.  **Image Input:** Whether you upload your own image or select one of our examples, the first step is providing the leaf image to the system.
    2.  **Image Preprocessing:** Before the model can understand the image, it needs to be prepared. This involves:
        * **Resizing:** All images are uniformly resized to 224x224 pixels, the standard input size for our model.
        * **Normalization:** Pixel values are adjusted to a specific range (between -1 and 1), which helps the neural network process them effectively.
    3.  **Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2:**
        * Our model is based on **MobileNetV2**, a powerful yet lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Google.
        * It was initially trained on a massive dataset of general images (**"ImageNet"**), allowing it to learn to recognize a wide variety of features (edges, textures, shapes).
        * Through **transfer learning**, we adapted this pre-trained model by adding a few custom layers and retraining it specifically on images of tomato leaves. This allows it to recognize subtle patterns indicative of different diseases.
    4.  **Prediction by TensorFlow Lite:**
        * The model performs its analysis and outputs a set of probabilities, indicating how likely the image is to belong to each of the 11 defined classes (e.g., Bacterial Spot, Healthy, Early Blight).
        * **TensorFlow Lite** is used for this step. It's a specialized version of TensorFlow optimized for efficient execution on mobile and edge devices, ensuring quick predictions even on less powerful hardware.
    5.  **Result Display:** The application then presents the most probable disease and a confidence score. It also shows the probabilities for other potential diseases, giving you a comprehensive understanding.
